# SpaceArp_CDPA2016
Processing  Open CV to calculate average flow of movement, and sends MIDI notes via Ableton. Set in C scale minor 


#Read you wrote you 


Synopsis
This code is developed for Space Arp, a collision, which is an audiovisual installation that detects the average flow of movement, and translates it to sound though Ableton. Movement is set to play random notes in a C minor scale, iterating though 3x3 instruments. A shadow display is visualising the movement through 3 light sources via DMX output. 


Motivation
This code is developed for a master student project for IT University of Copenhagen, for the course Digital Creative Practice. 

Installation
Needs a camera feed, DMX input can be commented out. Music Software that can output MIDI (I use Ableton) 

Set MIDI IAC driver online, set the required amount of Buses you will use. 
Set your music software to play from the Bus and channel according to the code.
